#             HOW TO INSTALL ENG2		  #
#                                                 #

Before installation please check that you have the compiler g++ >= 4.8

1)Run the following commands in egn2 folder :

./install.sh

source ~/.basrc

This script will install NCBI blast tool, Diamond and Exonerate.
They will be used only by egn2.


2) Check by typing the following command and press enter :

egn2

you should have the following message where PATH is the directory where EGN2 is installed: 

----- Usage of ENG2 -----

Case 1: You do not have computed the similarity between sequences.
/PATH/egn2 -f file.fasta -s [nucl or prot] -m [blast or diamond] -a attributes.file

Case 2: You have computed the similarity between sequences.
/PATH/egn2 -n similarity_file -a attributes.file -h header

-- optional -- 
-h header
-d workDir

3) In the folder named egn2config you find the files with the parameters for egn2 
and similarity tools that you can modify.

1) file.fasta
Fasta format file with nucleic or proteic sequences

2) attributes.file
This must be a tab delimited file containing the exact sequences name follwed by the genome name.
e.g. :

gene1	genome1
gene2	genome1
...	...
geneN	genomeM

3)similarity_file 
If you have already computed the similarities between the sequence, you can give that file as an input using '-n' and 
must give the header using '-h'. Beware you file should contain the follwing information :
--> qseqid sseqid evalue pident qstart qend qlen sstart send slen
The attribute file must be given along and the gene names must be the same as in the similarity file.

Main folder : egn2_filename_date_time


subfolder "configfiles" : This folder will contain a copy of all egn2 configuration files used for your data.

subfolder "networks" : This folder will contain the networks in GDF format to be used with Gephi. 

			- ConnetedComponents.gdf : Contains the networks of each connected component (CC). 
				
				* node information : node id , sequence name, genome name, CC id
				* edge information : percentage of identity between connected sequence

			- ccNetwork.gdf : Contains the network of CCs.
			
				* node information : node id , CC id, Number of sequences in the CC, Number of genomes in the CC
                                * edge information : number of similar sequences (hits) between two CCs

			- GenomeCCNetwork.gdf : Contains the genomes networks showing the shared CCs between genomes.

				* node information : node id, genome name
				* edge information : number of shared CCs between two genomes

			- GenomeSeqNetwork.gdf : Contains the genomes networks showing the shared sequences between genomes.
		
				* node information : node id, genome name, number of sequences in the genome
                                * edge information : number of similar sequences (hits) between two genomes

			- CC.info : Contains the following information for each CC :
				
				* CCid
				* nodes
				* edges
				* connectivity
				* meanPident	
				* sdPident	
				* NbGenomes
	
			- CC.genomeInfo : Contains a table showing the presence/absence of genomes in CCs

			- CC.nodes and CC.edges: Contain respectively the node ids and edges for each CCs in a fasta like format.


##### The following folders will be created only if you have not precomputed the similarity between sequences #####

subfolder "cleanNetwork": This folder will contain the filtered and formated similiraty output. Each sequence are represented by a unique number, 
                          all self-hits are removed and only the best hit is kept (i.e. lowest E- value) amongst multiple hits between pairs of sequences.

subfolder "similarityRes": This folder will contain the raw similarity output.
